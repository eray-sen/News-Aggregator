# News-Aggregator
 This project is a News Aggregator Website that fetches and displays news articles from the News API. The website features two main sections accessible via the navbar: "News" and "Sources". Users can select a country and category to filter the news articles displayed. Clicking on a news article shows detailed information and provides a link to the original source.
